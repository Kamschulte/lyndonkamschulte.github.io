      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a data-driven digital marketer and optimization strategist with
        over 6 years of experience helping companies turn insights into growth.
        I specialize in the overlap of A/B testing, personalization, and user
        experience, developing data-backed strategies that not only improve
        websites but deliver measurable business impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've led experimentation, CRO and website data analysis efforts at large
        enterprises like UnitedHealth Group, AbbVie, Autodesk, and Sling TV, as well as in fast-paced
        agency environments. Whether it’s launching high-impact A/B tests or
        personalizations, uncovering friction points with heatmaps, or
        partnering cross-functionally to improve UX/UI, I thrive on solving
        complex challenges that make digital experiences better for real people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love collaborating with talented cross-functional teams and believe the
        best results come from strong partnerships between data, design, and
        development.
      </p>
      <p><strong>If you're seeking expertise in A/B testing, personalization, or analytics, I'd love to discuss how I can contribute.</strong></p>
